- (optional but recommended) [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) the NFT standard
- (optional) Check corresponding EIP for the standard. Know what is EIP as it will affect your releases at some point.

## Libraries

- [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) for smart contracts/tokens and other pre-built sources. Refer to the docs.

Typically goes into your `package.json` Then use it in your Solidity solution.
